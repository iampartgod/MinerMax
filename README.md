A mining management tool for individual Starch.one miners, designed to handle multiple miners simultaneously. Inspired by TaterSharp’s clean and user-friendly output, MinerMAX automates block submissions and tracks stats for your solo miners, giving you full control and clear insights without relying on company pools. Ideal for miners running several rigs who want streamlined, pretty output and efficient multi-miner management.

- Mine from your browser, as STRCH was intended.
- Mine and track block submissions for multiple miners (no known limit).
- Clear and concise visual on what's going on - right infront of you.
