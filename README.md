A mining management tool for individual Starch.one miners, designed to handle multiple miners simultaneously. Inspired by TaterSharpâ€™s clean and user-friendly output, MinerMAX automates block submissions and tracks stats for your solo miners, giving you full control and clear insights without relying on company pools. Ideal for miners running several rigs who want streamlined, pretty output and efficient multi-miner management.

- Mine from your browser, as STRCH was intended.
- Mine and track block submissions for multiple miners (no known limit).
- Clear and concise visual on what's going on - right infront of you.

# This is under continuous front-end improvement and back-end development, and as such, is subject to updates at any given time(s). It it generally recommended to restart your auto-mining operations by re-clicking "Start Mining" atleast every 24-48 hours.
